Hello, welcome to my project

I want to create a mock porgram that utilizes python, SQL, and PowerBI to move, store, select, and display mortgage data,
for the purposes of showing these skills on a resume / in an interview

Things I need to do:

create a python script that pulls in data from an excel file
convert that information into a SQL database
use SQL to pull specific data
push that data into PowerBI
create 4 graphs in PowerBI based on this data

# got held up by logging into PowerBI
